<p>SNEmulDS release 0.6<br />                       (c) 1997-1999,2006-2007 by archeide<br />                    Includes CPU core from SnezziDS (by bubble2k)<br />	              and sound engine from PocketSPC (by gladius)<br />                          <br />  SNEmulDS is partially based on SNEmul, a SNES emulator for DOS<br />  and linux, which was the cooperative work of archeide & v0x.<br />  Take a look at the site of the DOS emulator: [url]http://www.snemul.com/ds/[/url]<br />  SNEmulDS includes PocketSPC, a SPC song player made by gladius.<br />  PocketSPC website : [url]http://pocketspc.pocketheaven.com/[/url]<br />  It also has integrated the fabulous CPU core from the equally <br />  fabulous SnezziDS. SnezziDS website : <br />  [url]http://www.forwardcoding.com/projects/snezzids/snezzids.html[/url]<br />  <br />  GUI artworks have been made tichat! Many thanks...<br />  The icon have been made by Lestat! Thanks again<br /><br />  1.

Introduction<br /><br />  Nearly ten years after the heroic times of the first SNES emulators <br />  (SNEmul was one of them), the new console made by Nintendo, the Nintendo DS,<br />  offer new opportunites to turn alive again all those old games which probaby<br />  made the Super NES the best 2D game system of all time.<br />  It was clear for me that i had to port my old emulator to the new console,<br />  because i wanted so hard to play my favorite SNES games on the tiny DS.<br />  There are already good emulators for the DS, but i wanted also to make my old<br />  project alive again, and remember those times where i lost<br />  nights tracking bugs in MARIO or Secret Of Mana!<br />    <br />  3. Installation and usage<br /><br />  Current version of SNEmulDS needs a card reader (like M3, supercard, G6, <br />  R4DS, NinjaDS, etc.)<br />  and a passkey/passcard (You should know how to get/use them) for slot-2<br />  devices.  <br />  <br />  <!> Note about DLDI<br />  <br />  At least the following devices should be supported thanks to the DLDI system <br />  made by chishm:<br /><br />    * DSLink (microSD Card)<br />    * Ewin2 (SD Card)<br />    * EZ Flash 4 (SD Card)<br />    * EZ Flash 5 (SD Card)<br />    * G6 Flash  (version 0.15)<br />    * M3 Adapter (Compact Flash)<br />    * M3 Adapter (SD card)<br />    * Max Media Dock (Compact Flash)<br />    * GBA Movie Player (Compact Flash)<br />    * GBA Movie Player (SD Card)<br />    * NEO Flash MK2 & MK3 (SD Card)<br />    * NEO2 (SD Card)<br />    * Ninja DS (SD Card)<br />    * R4(DS)- Revolution for DS, M3 Simply compatible<br />    * SuperCard (Compact Flash)<br />    * SuperCard DS (Slot-1)<br />    * SuperCard (SD Card)<br /><br />  Take a look here: [url]http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/index.html[/url]<br />  You can patch SNEmulDS.nds to support others devices as long as those<br />  device have been made compatible with the DLDI system. <br />  So you should visit this site regularly for update, if your device is not<br />  supported by SNEmulDS yet!<br />  <br />  <!> SNEMUL.CFG is very important don't forget to put it in the root directory<br />  Now you have a snemul.cfg file to put in the root(which means "initial")<br />  directory of your card. You can choose the directory where<br />  you put your ROMS, instead of SNES as said in the following lines.<br />  <br />  - Create a SNES directory in the root directory of your card,<br />  - Put all your SNES ROMs in this directory,<br />  - Optionnaly patch SNEmulDS.nds with a DLDI patcher<br />  - Put SNEmulDS.nds or one of the SNEmulDS_<your device name here> in <br />    the _root_ directory of your card,<br /><br />  <br />  - Launch the game,<br />  - A list of all the SNES games appears, you can scroll with "up" and "down"<br />  - Tap on the desired game and press START to launch the game.<br />  <br /><br />  During the game, a menu is displayed with the following items:<br />  # SelectROM: show the content of a directory list to select another ROM<br />  # Options: show the option menu. There you can disable background,<br />    select the BG3 mode (see below) or the relative scroll height for<br />    BG1 and BG2, enable or disable the Vblank waiting, and enable/disable speed<br />    hacks.<br />  # Load State: restore one of your 8 game states. (see below)<br />  # Save State: save your current game state. You can save up to 8 game states<br />    for each game. States are saved in files put in the SNES directory along <br />    with your ROM (with extension .SM1 .SM2 ...). <br />  # Reset: reset the game<br />  # Save SRAM: save battery-saved cartridge RAM. The SRAM is saved in a file put<br />    in the SNES directory along with your ROM (the file has extension '.SRM').<br />  # SPC jukebox: play your favorite songs (from SPC files in your SNES directory)<br />  # GFX config: show the GFX config menu. (see below)<br />  # Debug: show debug informations (not really interesting stuff)<br /><br />  The BG3 mode selection allows the BG3 (in most games, a later containing only<br />  static informations) to be displayed entirely on the DS screen, even if it is<br />  bigger with a real SNES. It can be useful in some games. In fact, the middle of<br />  the layer is crushed, so you'll lose information in some games.<br /> <br />  SNES Mouse Emulation<br />  --------------------<br />  <br />  You can select the mouse emulation mode with START+L+R+LEFT, then the bottom<br />  screen and the upper screen switch. You use the stylus to move the mouse<br />  cursor.<br />  <br />  -> You can also switch the screen without selecting mouse emulation mode<br />  using START+L+R+RIGHT.<br />  <br />  Currently there are two methods of emulation:<br /><br />  # One for all games that uses SNES mouse. It compute the distance between<br />  two stylus "click" to emulate the move of the mouse.<br />  This is not accurate and some games like Populous II use non linear moving,<br />  so the mouse cursor doesn't follow the stylus.<br /><br />  # Another method modifies directly the variables in RAM where the game stores<br />  the X and Y positions of cursor. This way, the mouse cursor moves accurately.<br />  But i have to search for each game, where is this information <br />  (that's quite easy with a debugger anyway).<br />  The X Y address are stored in snemul.cfg. You need to have this file<br />  up-to-date.<br />  <br />  For both methods, the D-pad is used to select the way the stylus emulate<br />  the mouse:<br />  - press LEFT(or Y): when the touch screen is pressed, the mouse is moved to this<br />    point and the mouse's left button is pressed<br />  - press RIGHT(or A): when the touch screen is pressed, the mouse is moved to this<br />    point and the mouse's right button is pressed<br />  - press DOWN(or B): when the touch screen is pressed, the mouse is moved to this<br />    point<br />   When the touch screen is not pressed, the buttons are released and the cursor<br />   doesn't move.<br />   <br />  Another option is available with first method: <br />  - press UP (or X) and press the touchscreen at the same time :<br />    the stylus calibrates to this point. <br />    Use this if the mouse cursor doesn't follow the stylus correctly.<br />    <br />  In mouse mode, you can also scroll the entire screen (all backgrounds)<br />  with:<br />  - L(or R) + UP(or X)  : scroll up the screen<br />  - L(or R) + DOWN(or B) : scroll down the screen<br />  <br />  GFX config<br />  ----------<br />  <br />  This screen contains several options to try:<br />  <br />  - Priority per tile : in the SNES hardware, each background layer have <br />   two sub layers : high and low priority. The DS 2D hardware doesn't have<br />   this feature, but have one more background layer. This option uses<br />   tha additional layer to emulatoe the priority per tile for one SNES background.<br />   You can choose between none, BG1 or BG2. Warning: This option can corrupt GFX or<br />   make some other tiles disappear.<br /><br />  - BG3 block priority : this option emulate the priority per tile for BG3<br />    by guessing, for each line, if the map contains more high or more low<br />    priority tiles, and then change the priority of the BG3 for each line.<br />    This option is not perfect yet, and some text may disappear.<br />    This option only work in automatic mode.<br />    <br />  - BG1 / BG2 / BG3 / BGX(low) : change the priority of this layer. THe right<br />    part of screen, can select between automatic or not.<br />    <br />  - Sprite1 ... : change the priority of the sprites. SNES has 4 priorities<br />    like DS, but it can be useful to change the prioriry bijection.<br />    <br />  - (Fix) : the number are register 212C 212D 2130 3130, tap on this <br />    part of screen to clear the GFX buffers and fix most GFX garbages on screen.<br />    <br />  - <Save> : save those parameters in the CFG file    <br /><br /> <br />  4. What is implemented<br /><br />  - 65816 CPU (bugs remain, and 6502 emulation is not supported)<br />  - LoROM/HiROM support<br />  - Tile by tile graphics engine (broken as of 0.5 alpha)<br />  - Line by line graphics engine (90% complete)<br />  - Graphic Mode 1, 2, 3, 4, 7<br />  - Graphics Modes 0,5,6 are implemented but not correct yet<br />  - 8x8, 16x16 tiles (16x16 may have problem with large screen modes)<br />  - 32x32, 64x32, 32x64, 64x64 screen modes<br />  - 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, 64x64 sprites<br />  - BG priorities (still buggy)<br />  - Full DMA support<br />  - HDMA support (uncomplete)<br />  - HIRQ/VIRQ/NMI interrupts<br />  - PAL/NTSC detection<br />  - Subscren Add/sub for BG/sprites/BACK (not 100% correct yet)<br />  - Large ROM support (> 3Mbytes), even for slot-1 card users<br />  - SRAM support<br />  - Snapshots(State save) support<br />  - SPC700 CPU (from PocketSPC by gladius)<br />  - Sound DSP (from PocketSPC by gladius)<br />  - Incomplete Line by line graphics engine (for MODE 7 game)<br />  - Mode 7 effects<br />  - Correct BACK color support (look like ok)<br />  - SNES Mouse Emulation<br />  - Incomplete priority per tile (difficult task :-()  <br /><br /> <br />What is not supported, but will be soon:<br />  - Super scope emulation<br />  - 512 horizontal resolution with Mode 5 <br />  - Window clipping<br />  - Mosaic effects <br />  - Correct Sprite priorities<br />  - Palette alteration between scanlines (only palette 0 is correct)<br />  - Fixed color Add/sub for BG/sprites/BACK<br />  - Window color clipping<br />  <br /> <br />What will *maybe* be supported someday: <br />  - Super FX<br />  - DSP1<br />  - DSP2...<br /><br />Other interesting features to be implemented:<br />  - Cheats editor, Cheats search<br /><br />  - Memory, Palette viewer<br />  - Debugger<br />  - Tiles/Sprites editor(designe your own sprites with the pen ;))<br /><br /><br />  5. Misc<br /><br />  You can ask me question (not about SNES ROMs of course) at:<br />  [email]archeide@yahoo.com[/email]<br />  I don't have a lot of free time, so don't expect that i will<br />  answer to all your questions.<br />  <br />  A web site exists, you can get the latest version of SNEmulDS at:<br />  [url]http://www.snemul.com/ds/[/url]<br /><br />  If you are interested in working on this project, please tell me!<br />  I am especially interested in people who would like to work on a GUI for<br />  the subscreen! (But beware, you'll just have 48kbytes of VRAM for you :p)<br />  And if you have knowledge in ARM assembler and DS low level programming,<br />  i'm also interested ;)<br />  <br /><br />  6. FAQ<br /><br />  - My graphic are all corrupted, flashing, ugly, what can i do ?<br />  <br />    Go in the GFX config, and try to change options. Tap on "fix" zone<br />    to clear the GFX cache.   <br />    Try to enable "Wait for Vblank" in the options.<br />    You may also need to change the background layers order. <br />    You can do it in the options (instead of "Automatic layers") or by<br />    pressing START+L+R+UP (LEFT AND RIGHT side buttons).<br />    You can return to automatic layers by pressing START+LEFT+RIGHT+DOWN.<br />    Another option allow disabling or enabling background layers.<br />  <br />  - Why SNEmulDS sound is bad ?<br />  <br />    SNEmulDS is not correctly synchronized with the SPC700 engine.<br />    Some new options in configuration file allow you to improve<br />    the sound (see SoundPortSync in CFG file)<br />    You can try the SPC jukebox instead, musics should be better.<br /><br />  - Why SNEmulDS is so slow ?<br /><br />    Try to play with speed hacks in Option menu (Last item). Some games are slower<br />    than other, because of intensive use of CPU and GFX.<br />    Expect speed improvement in the future<br />  <br />  - How can i speed up SNEmulDS ?<br />  <br />    Make sure you are in "No vblank" mode in Options, and that "Speed hack"<br />    is in "Full speed".<br />    <br />  - Why my game seems slow whereas SNEmulDS says the speed is over 80% ? <br />  <br />    Most of the time, it comes from the speed hack. Not enough CPU cycles<br />    are given to the game, and it needs to use two frames instead of <br />    one. Set speed hacks "No speed hack" should help.<br /><br />  - My game is too fast! I can't even play it !<br />    Enable "Wait for Vblank" in the options.<br />  <br />  - My game doesn't even start! Your emu sucks!?<br />  <br />    Choose "No speed hack" and/or sound emulation in Options menu. <br />    Surprisely, some games need to be in "Full speed hacks" mode to launch<br />    (like SUPER BOMBERMAN).<br />  <br />  - I lost all my game progress !!! I will kill you!<br /> <br />    Don't forget that SNEmulDS doesn't save SRAM automatically.<br />    You have to tap "Save SRAM" in the main menu to save your game progress.<br />    You can also use save states.<br /><br />  - Save states don't work :(<br /><br />    I'm sorry but the current FAT librairies doesn't support<br />    saving for all cards. Use of DS SRAM is a future feature<br />    that may be help you (short: wait for next release).<br />    TO BE PEACEFUL: writing to card is not perfect, and your saved state<br />    can be corrupted, so you should save your game in several slots!!<br /><br />  - How i can use my own ZSNES/SNES9X save states ?<br /> <br />    I think I will make a ZST->SML translator in the first time...<br />    In the future, there will be direct compatibility with ZSNES<br />    format. (short: wait!)<br />    Anyway, you should be able to use your ".SRM" created by<br />    other emus. Be sure it is not compressed. Simply put the<br />    SRM file in the SNES directory, along with your ROM.<br /><br />  - Why do you not support "packing", my card/flasher is not<br />    working with SNEmulDS?<br />   <br />    SNEmul philosophy is "easy to use".<br />    That means no pre-script, no packer, no patches, etc. <br />    You put your ROMS, SRAMs, save states directly in your SNES directory and that's all.<br />    Moreover, by using a "real" filesytem development of specific features is much easier<br />    (especially large save states, SRAM saving, very large ROMs (4Mo) and  multi ROMs support).<br />    I will surely work on a "packed" version later, but this is not <br />    my first goal.<br /><br />  8.
