<p>软件名：pocketspc<br />作  者：<br />官方网站： [url]http://pocketspc.pocketheaven.com[/url]<br />用  途：sfc音乐格式spc播放器<br />spc下载：[url]http://www.snesmusic.org/[/url]<br />更新历史：<br /><br />[quote]History<br />-------<br /><br />Version 0.9<br />-----------<br />- Rewrote timer code, it is now both faster and more accurate<br />- Fixed KON register issue with Der Langrisser<br />- Updated the builder with add directory support<br /><br />Version 0.8.1<br />-------------<br />- Removed sample caching on arm9 version, caused errors in a few songs like mega man x<br />- Fixed bug with screen display going wild on songs like star ocean (caused by negative volumes)<br />- Fixed bug that multiplied master echo volume by master volume.  (fixes legend, and echo volume on a lot)<br /><br />Version 0.8<br />-----------<br />- Optimized timer updating, new key on/off code, cpu usage down by a fair bit<br />- Allowed writes to envx/outx<br />- Fixed stupid bug with direct envelope setting (fixes super turrican)<br />- Improved accuracy of envelope and channel volume multiplication, better sound quality<br />- Fixed bug (again) with going backwards before the first song<br />- More bug fixes and speed increases to the SnesDS version<br /><br />Version 0.7<br />-----------<br />- Added Gaussian interpolation - samples sound much nicer<br />- Increased accuracy of DSP/APU integration<br />- Better emulation of key-on and key-off registers<br />- Changed around dsp register writes, should be more accurate<br />- Envx and Outx are cleared on key-on now<br />- Changed DSP ram to have 256 bytes, so reads are no longer mirrored<br />- Fixed stupid bug with DSP register reads - any songs that read from envx were broken<br />  (fixes dq1, doom, rnh, bt&dd, a lot more)<br />- Fixed bugs and added echo emulation to SnesDS version<br /><br />Version 0.6<br />-----------<br />- Reverted change that should have fixed bugs, but instead seems to break more songs<br />  (fixes bt&dd, rudra no hihou, others)<br />- Fixed bug in builder with long filenames<br />- Randomize works better, like winamp now, uses rtc to seed random as well<br />- Fixes for arm7 version (snesds)<br />- Added sync code to arm7 version (snesds)<br /><br />Version 0.5<br />-----------<br />- Added timer speed up hack to CPU core<br />- Changed timer updating code, quite a nice speed gain from that<br />- Fixed dumb bug with note key on not setting envelope up properly<br />- Fixed bug when changing envelope while sample was playing (FF2)<br />- HUGE bug fixed on looping samples..  wasn't resetting the block pointer on first looped block<br />  This fixes a lot of the crackling/buzzing samples finally.  FF3 Edgar&Sabin for example (many others)<br />- Rewrote BRR decoding yet again, should hopefully be the last time<br />- Fixed bug on loading SPC state, fixes actraiser, soul blader, metroid, others<br />- Fixed sample volume bug, fixes star ocean<br /><br />Version 0.4<br />-----------<br />- Backported to arm9 for increased speed (arm7 version still being updated for snesds)<br />- Moved mixing rate back up to 32000Hz<br />- Removed echo hack, added proper echo emulation and FIR filtering, feel the reverb :)<br />- Recoded most of the mixer for increased speed<br />- Fixed modifying kon,koff,endx when sample was turned off, fixes some samples ending too soon<br />- Fixed SPC666 song length being off sometimes - the spc format sucks<br />- Fixed BRR decoding bug - wasn't clamping format 2&3, fixes samples that sounded really strange<br /><br />Version 0.3<br />-----------<br />- Enabled preamp which I forgot to do in last release<br />- Added PCALL/SLEEP opcodes, should help compatibility<br />- KON/KOFF were being trashed on write, fixed<br />- Fixed setting of ADSR when note was in release state<br />- When note is finished, envelope state is set to none now<br />- Fixed TCALL opcode, Rudra no Hihou now works (probably others as well...)<br />- End of sample block decoding bug(s) fixed - finally fixes errant samples playing in zelda & many others<br />- Added echo hack so that songs that were silent before now play back (earthbound)<br />  This hack can also cause some issues with songs that use the echo with some wierd filters, such as some of the<br />  final fantasy 3 songs.<br />- Improved accuracy of BRR decoding, samples are more accurate now<br />- Dropped mixing rate to 24000Hz, gets rid of crackling during intense songs (legend of the mystical ninja)<br /><br />Version 0.2<br />-----------<br />- Added SPC666 extra info display<br />- Ported to Arm7 and rewrote BRR decoding & mixing in asm<br />- Implemented EOR1/AND1/OR1/TCALL, fixes games that use them<br />- Added support for inport/outport handling - you can now see this in snesDS :)<br />- Added ENVX & OUTX handling, fixes samples looping forever on some games<br />- Fixed crash bug writing to high 0x40 bytes of memory - fixes fzero<br />- Fixed DSP mirroring of address > 0x7f<br />- Attack ENVX now starting at 0 (was starting at 1)<br />- Push/Pop PSW was messed up (Not using/setting DP or H flag)<br />- DSP KOFF register was broken, not setting envelope speed when setting<br />  Release state, fixes quite a few games that had infinite looping sounds.<br />- Fixed MUL YA, was not clearing Z flag when A was 0x80<br />- Fixed DIV, was not setting V flag when Y >= X, fixes Mariokart and StarOcean!<br />- Removed 'optimization' that didn't do any register checking sometimes, caused bugs<br />- Bug fixed in op (X),(Y) form instructions, didn't take DP into account<br />- Bug fixed in op DP+reg form instructions, could access outside DP<br />- Bug fixed in SBC (X),(Y), reversed the order of the subtraction<br />- Bug fixed in op #,(X) instruction, (X) address was not using DP flag<br /><br />Version 0.1<br />-----------<br />- Ported from GBA, rewrote CPU core, rewrote DSP core<br />- Support for stereo added<br />- Mixing rate set to SNES's 32000Hz<br />- Still missing echo/filter emulation for the DSP<br />- CPU bugs/unimplemented opcodes remain, if you encounter a song that plays very poorly, e-mail me<br />[/quote]<br />[attach]2714[/attach]<br />[attach]2715[/attach][i=s] 本帖最后由 qxshark 于 2010-2-9 17:41 编辑 [/i]<br /><br /></p>
