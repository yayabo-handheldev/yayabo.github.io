However I just recently returned to the lameboy project and started with some small issues. It is possible that you won’t need to wait another year for the next release.<br /><br />Lameboy DS 0.12<br /><br />Change log:<br /><br />fixed: better interrupt timing (should fix Mario Land 2 boss levels) <br />fixed: multipacket SGB messages (fixes Pokemon R/G/B in battle color overlays) <br />added: backlight of the menu screen is turned off when not used <br />added: fullscreen scaling (ignores aspect ratio) <br /><br /><br />Lameboy DS 0.11<br />April 19th, 2008 <br />This release has very short change log and does not address many of the problems pointed out in last post comments. I have managed to fix annoying SGB multi player games input problem though. Apart from this the only difference to 0.10 is emulation speed. Both video render and CPU interpreter were heavily optimized. Sadly some games still won’t do its 60fps.<br /><br />Since majority of the code base was touched in process of optimization there can be some regression in compatibility. Please report games that stopped working (or degraded in some way) with this version in comments.<br /><br />Lameboy DS 0.11<br /><br />Change log:<br /><br />changed: optimized software renderer <br />changed: optimized cpu core <br />fixed: multiplayer pad reading in SGB games (Battle Arena Toshinden and others) <br /><br /><br />Lameboy DS 0.10<br />March 16th, 2008 <br />It’s been a long time since last news from Lameboy project. In fact it was not active for some time, but now is back with lots of new features. Actually with so many changes you can consider it beta as certainly there will be problems with some still. So here you go.<br /><br />Lameboy DS 0.10<br /><br />Change log:<br /><br />changed: updated devkitARM and associated libraries to r21 <br />fixed: STOP opcode (fixes Konami Collection 2 JP & 4 JP) <br />fixed: found and reverted patch that caused problem with pumpkin level in Mario Land 2 <br />fixed: another change in interrupt handling to fix Monster Rancher Explorer <br />fixed: palette change effects <br />fixed: interrupt enable register, fixes graphic glitches in Pokemon Pinball and Donkey Kong <br />fixed: DAA opcode flags <br />added: Super GameBoy borders and coloring support <br />added: rumble emulation with slot 2 rumble pak <br />added: menu <br />added: green color scheme for classic gb <br />added: configurable x/y key functions <br />added: save states <br />Save states are in early phase now, but somehow working. As a feature when save state is used game is not saved to regular .sav at the same time. Super Gameboy emulation on the other hand is pretty much done (of course no SNES sounds, as in other emulators).<br /><br />Note for 3in1 expansion rumble: To use 3in1 Expansion Pack in Lameboy you need other software that enable it and slot1 device with soft reset capability. It was tested with 3in1_ExpPack_tool.<br /><br />Note for M3 SD/CF and other slot2 devices users: I have removed all card drivers from libfat except for DLDI, so you have to dldi patch it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lameboy DS 0.9<br />July 15th, 2007 <br />Here it comes. Not as many fixes as I expected to put in this release, but did not want to delay it any longer. There is no change to sound core so don’t expect any improvement there.<br /><br />Remember what I said about no hardware bilinear upscaling in NDS in the last note? Actually I was wrong - you can get it with some simple tricks. So now you can toggle between no scaling / nearest neighbour / bilinear with Y button.<br /><br />Lamboy DS 0.9<br /><br />Changelog:<br /><br />fixed: joypad register emulation (fixes Wario Blast) <br />fixed: GBC hdma (fixes Pokemon Crystal graphics) <br />fixed: interrupt flags emulation (fixes Bouble Bobble) <br />fixed: V-blank interrupt timing (fixes Altered Space) <br />fixed: split window emulation (fixes Donkey Kong graphics) <br />fixed: GB timer initialization (fixes Pokemon Pinball) <br />added: fake serial interrupts (fixes many early games) <br />added: RTC emulation <br />added: pseudo bilinear upscaling mode <br />RTC feature needs more explanation. I tested it with only one game - Pokemon Crystal, so it can be considered beta. The emulated time is always synchronized to NDS RTC and not affected by fast mode. It’s the same behaviour as in VBA and opposite to GNUBoy’s. Also save style is compatible to VBA, with one issue: I think there is no way to check time zone in NDS (as it is not set) so I fixed it to +2h. If your timezone is different you will get timeshift between Lameboy and VBA.<br /><br /><br /><br />Status update<br />June 27th, 2007 <br />There’s been a while since last Lameboy release, so I will give you some idea what is happening now. Also I would like to thank all you guys supporting this project on various forums. Especially Wrecking_Crew (for numerous bug reports thanks to which you have fully working Zeldas), DanTheMan (for PHWiki page) and sonicandtails (compatibilty list).<br /><br />So what’s happening to Lameboy DS now. Recently I don’t have so much time for development but some things changed from 0.8. My main goal at this step is to obtain reasonable compatibility before I go to some optimizations or new features. The only new feature in next release will be probably real time clock for Pokemon games which is actually already done. I have also already did about 5 compatibility patches that make many games playable, most notably Wario Blast input problem (thanks again Wrecking Crew) and Pokemon Crystal graphic glitches and Bubble Bobble. Currently I am working on Pokemon Pinball crashes.<br /><br />Lastly some comments on sugested features:<br /><br />custom classic GB colors - planned <br />custom border - possible <br />SGB borders and coloring - planned (quite complex to do and not very fun, but the result would be nice) <br />better/bilinear upscaling - not really likely to happen as current full screen feature is a hardware thing and there is no processing power to do software scaling with fancy algorithm. on the other hand I will not remove this feature because some may like it (although I agree with Harshboy that is looks bad) <br />emulated link/IR port feature - planned (although hard to do unless someone else do generic ad-hoc networking for libwifi or libnds first, and also I would need to get my hands on another NDS) <br />GS/GG codes - planned, fairly easy but I am afraid that full implementation would ruin performance (at least when emulated the way VBA does) <br />If I forgot something or you have other suggestions feel free to comment.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lameboy DS 0.8<br />June 12th, 2007 <br />To celebrate Lameboy Devlog grand opening here comes new release featuring initial sound emulation. You cannot turn it off yet, but it always possible to turn it down by hardware volume control. Also you can forget about X button annoyance, just return to rom menu for autosave.<br /><br />Lameboy DS 0.8<br /><br />Full changelog follows:<br /><br />fixed: GBC speed change did not work for some games (like Mario Bros Deluxe) <br />fixed: interrupt priority <br />fixed: corrected timers interrupt frequency <br />fixed: tile in foreground color 0 is transparent <br />added: preliminary sound emulation <br />added: auto save on exit to rom menu <br />[/quote]<br />[attach]2935[/attach][i=s] 本帖最后由 qxshark 于 2010-2-12 16:18 编辑 [/i]<br /><br /></p>
